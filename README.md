# command-meta
Bukkit plugin for custom /help with tabcompletion support

With this simple plugin you can manually override all bukkit commands that are hinted to different players depending on their permissions.

`config.yml` is pretty self-explainatory, if you have any problems - feel free to DM me on discord: `DelfikPro#1021`
